# rustprox
a replacement for the tor network made in rust i dont think i will ever get around to doing this
its just an idea at the moment but basicaly this going to be some thing like the tor network or i2p only
faster better and made in rust and can run on a local mesh network and is meant to run high latency anyone
can create a node there are no requirements but the overall goal here is to create a hidden network that
anybody can use an can run on a toaster connected to some flaky wifi connection
